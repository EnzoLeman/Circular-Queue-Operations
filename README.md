# Circular Queue Operation in Java

This repository contains an implementation of circular queue operations in Java. It includes classes and methods for enqueueing, dequeueing, and other queue-related functionalities, specifically for circular queue structures. This project is designed for learning and demonstration purposes.

## Features
- Implementation of a circular queue.
- Methods for enqueue, dequeue, and checking queue status (full/empty).
- Example usage with a main program.
- Object-oriented and easy-to-understand code.

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started with writing Java code in Visual Studio Code.

### Prerequisites
- Install [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
- Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Add the [Java Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack) to VS Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains the following folders:

- `src`: The folder to maintain source code.
- `lib`: The folder to maintain dependencies.

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> To customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings accordingly.

## Running the Program
1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
2. Use the **Run and Debug** view or right-click the `Main.java` file in the `src` folder to run the program.
3. Follow the prompts in the terminal to perform queue operations.
4. The output will display the current state of the circular queue.

## How Circular Queue Works
- The queue operates in a circular fashion, meaning the next element after the last position is the first position.
- Ensures efficient utilization of space by reusing empty slots.

## Example Usage
1. Enqueue elements into the circular queue.
2. Dequeue elements and observe the queue's circular behavior.
3. Check if the queue is full or empty using provided methods.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view in VS Code allows you to manage your dependencies easily. For more details, refer to the [official documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
